### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on networking problems (mostly queueing systems and RF localization) for multi-robot systems exploring unknown environments.

I'm interested in field robotics, satellite constellations, and improving public transportation in Los Angeles!

Feel free to get in touch at lilliamc@usc.edu.
